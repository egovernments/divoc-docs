# Issuing COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates in  Sri Lanka

## **Overview**

Sri Lanka went live with DIVOC in July 2021. DIVOC has been integrated with an existing platform in Sri Lanka - the District Health Information Software (DHIS2) - to generate COVID-19 certificates for its citizens. DIVOC has also set up a portal to verify these certificates.

Sri Lankaâ€™s Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) in collaboration with the Department of Health (DOH) has implemented DIVOC. The integration of DIVOC with DHIS2 was a collaborative effort by HISP Sri Lanka (local DHIS2 partner) and the ICTA.

We will give you an overview of the different features and services of DIVOC that have been implemented in Sri Lanka and the standard used.
