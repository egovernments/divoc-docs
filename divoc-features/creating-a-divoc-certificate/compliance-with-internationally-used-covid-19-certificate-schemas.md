# Compliance with internationally used COVID-19 certificate schemas

Digitally verifiable certificates have emerged as a solution to help open up businesses and travel globally during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There are four major COVID-19 certificate schemas popularly used in the world today:

* EU-DCC
* DIVOC (native COVID-19 certificate schema)
* SmartHealthCards&#x20;
* ICAO-VDS

As the interoperability of these certificate schemas is critical to streamline the international travel process, DIVOC has added the ability to issue digital certificates in the EU-DCC and SmartHealthCard formats today, in addition to the native DIVOC COVID-19 certificate format. This will enable citizens of a country using a DIVOC certificate system, to export their native certificates in a format that is acceptable in the travel destination country. \


Note: DIVOC will be also adding the capability to export the certificates in the ICAO-VDS format, in 2022.
