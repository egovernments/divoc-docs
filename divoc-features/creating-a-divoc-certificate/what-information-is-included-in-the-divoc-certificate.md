# What information is included in the DIVOC certificate?

DIVOCâ€™s W3C-based digital certificate consists of three core components:

1. Credential metadata (schema version credential/certificate ID, etc).&#x20;
2. Claim (vaccination event details).&#x20;
3. Proof (issuer details, date of issue, time stamp, signature, etc).

### Data structure

The DIVOC digital certificate QR code includes the following data structure:

| Basic components                                       | Information sections         | Description                                                                                                                    |
