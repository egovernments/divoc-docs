## What is DIVOC?

The <mark style="color:orange;">**Digital Infrastructure**</mark>** for Verifiable Open Credentialing** or <mark style="color:orange;">**DI**</mark>**VOC** is an **open-source platform** that enables countries to digitally orchestrate large-scale health campaigns such as vaccination and certification programs.

Learn more about the platform on the [**DIVOC**](https://divoc.dev/) website **** or **** [**Contact us**](https://divoc.dev/#get-in-touch) **** for more details.

## **Facilitates last-mile delivery of health programs at scale**

* Built in India for the world as a <mark style="color:orange;">**digital public good**</mark>, DIVOC is a flexible and extendable software that can be used across multiple health programs.
* Its scalable and data-driven architecture allows it to deal with diverse country-specific scenarios. In a vaccination programme, for example, it gives countries the ability to manage and control vaccines, facilities, and vaccinators systematically across geographies, as well as generate digitally variable certificates that are compliant with international standards.

## **Our Key Modules**

* The platform is modular, enabling countries to use the components together or as an individual standalone solution, according to their need, for end-to-end vaccination and certification.
* DIVOC has two core modules:

&#x20;            1\. Issue and Verify Certificates

&#x20;            2\. Analytics
