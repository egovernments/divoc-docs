### What is DIVOC?

The <mark style="color:orange;">**Digital Infrastructure**</mark>** for Vaccination Open Credentialing** or <mark style="color:orange;">**DI**</mark>**VOC** is an **open-source platform** that enables countries to digitally orchestrate large-scale health campaigns such as vaccination and certification programs.

Learn more about the platform on our website: **** [**https://divoc.dev/**](https://divoc.dev) **** or **** [**Contact us**](https://divoc.dev) **** for more details.

### **Facilitates last-mile delivery of health programs at scale**

* Built in India for the world as a digital public good, DIVOC is a flexible and extendable software that can be used across multiple health programs.
* Its scalable and data-driven architecture allows it to deal with diverse country-specific scenarios. In a vaccination program, for example, it gives countries the ability to manage and control vaccines, facilities, and vaccinators systematically across geographies, as well as generate digitally variable certificates that are compliant with international standards.

### **Our Key Modules**

* The platform is modular. Countries can use the modules or components together or independently, according to their need, for end-to-end vaccination and certification.
* Allows easy integration with existing systems.
* Click on End User Guide to play around with each module (Coming soon).
