# What information goes into a QR Code?

A vaccination certificate is a proof that a person has received the shot to protect them from an infectious disease such as COVID-19 or the flu. We have given below the type of information (mandatory and optional) that should be there in a QR code-based COVID-19 vaccination certificate, as specified by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
