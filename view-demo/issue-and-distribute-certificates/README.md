# Issue and Distribute Certificates

## What this module allows:

* Countries can use this module to issue digitally verifiable certificates to the entire population at speed and scale in a controlled manner post-vaccination.
* This module is responsible for issuing a QR code-based digital certificate for any registered health event. Click [**here**](verifiable-qr-code.md) to know more about the difference between a normal QR code and a verifiable QR code.
* The certificates can be distributed in both digital and physical forms. You can distribute certificates in print, pdf, and other formats via the [**facility app**](../facility-app.md). It can also be downloaded by citizens using the [**citizen portal**](../citizen-portal.md). If the country has an authorised third-party app, it can be integrated with DIVOC's credentialing module to fetch certificates from the certificate registry and view/download them.

![Once the certificate is issued, multi-channel distribution and print schemes should work to ensure users and countries have a choice.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-12-20 at 3.14.45 PM.png>)

* The module supports multilingual vaccination certificate templates.&#x20;
* Generates WHO-DDCC compliant digital vaccination certificates with a W3C JSON schema, for every resident after successful inoculation. To aid travel into other countries, the certificate module supports on-demand services for travellers to export their vaccination certificates to other formats (e.g. EU-DCC, SmartHealthCard), used in the destination countries.&#x20;
* The module supports additional services, including certificate verification, certificate update/correction, and certificate revocation.&#x20;
* The public key of the adopter country can be published using DIVOCâ€™s verification page that can be embedded into the country's vaccination program-specific website/portal.
