# Issue and Verify Certificates

## What does this module allow?&#x20;

* It allows issuing authorities to issue digitally verifiable certificates.&#x20;
* The [**facility app**](../facility-app.md) can be used to generate digital certificates, as well as distribute them.
* The staff of a particular facility can use the [**facility app**](../facility-app.md) to verify a beneficiary.
* Certificates can also be verified and downloaded via the [**citizen portal**](../citizen-portal.md#3.-for-certificate-verification). &#x20;
* If the country has an authorised third-party app, it can be integrated with DIVOC's credentialing module to fetch certificates from the certificate registry and view/download them.
