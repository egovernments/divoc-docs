# DIVOC Verifiable Certificate Features

## Purpose

This section describes the key features of DIVOC and how they work.

## What is DIVOC's issue and verify certificate module?

* Countries can use the DIVOC's certificate module to issue <mark style="color:orange;">**digitally verifiable certificates**</mark> to the entire population at speed and scale in a controlled manner post-vaccination.
* This module is responsible for issuing a QR code-based digital certificate for any registered health event. It can be adapted to other areas too where there is a requirement for secure and tamper-proof documents, such as educational certificates.&#x20;
* The certificates can be issued in both digital and physical forms, which includes print, pdf, and other formats.&#x20;

![Once the certificate is issued, multi-channel distribution and print schemes should work to ensure users and countries have a choice.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-12-20 at 3.14.45 PM.png>)

* The module supports multilingual vaccination certificate templates.&#x20;
* Generates WHO-DDCC (World Health Organisation- Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates) compliant digital vaccination certificates with a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) JSON schema, for every resident after successful inoculation.&#x20;
* To aid travel into other countries, the certificate module supports on-demand services for travellers to export their vaccination certificates to other formats (e.g. EU-DCC, SmartHealthCard), used in the destination countries.&#x20;
* The module supports additional services, including certificate verification, certificate update/correction, and certificate revocation.&#x20;
* The public key of the adopter country can be published using DIVOCâ€™s verification page that can be embedded into the country's vaccination program-specific website/portal.
