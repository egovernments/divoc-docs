# Feedback

### Who would typically use this?&#x20;

DIVOC has a feedback module that can be configured by countries to receive feedback on facilities that are running health campaigns. It can also configure a list of side effects that can be reported by beneficiaries with a single click after authenticating themselves with a user ID password or mobile OTP via the “Citizen Portal”
