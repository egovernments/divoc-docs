  Each component of DIVOC can be used independently or together and integrated

# End User Guide: Introduction to DIVOC Modules

### **How this demo works**

The tutorials will guide you on how to use DIVOC:

* There are 6 sections and you can play around with each to understand how they work as per your specific needs.&#x20;

**Or,**

* You can go step-by-step as shown below: Orchestration - Facility app - Certificate issuance & distribution - Citizen portal - Feedback module - Analytics.

### Getting Started

#### [1. Orchestration: ](orchestration.md)

Before you start any public health program in your country, the orchestration\
module helps you establish multiple registries for the program, set up appointment schedules, and add vaccinators.

#### [2.  Facility app:](facility-app.md)&#x20;

Enables walk-in registrations, verification, queue management, and vaccination. The app lets you:

* Enrol/register beneficiaries who walk into the facility for on-the-spot registration. The process to register is the same as shown for the [**citizen portal**](citizen-portal.md). Pre-enrolled recipients can also walk into a facility.
* Verification of beneficiaries via offline or online mode.
* Recipient queue to view and manage the list of beneficiaries enrolled into the system.
* Vaccination event recording and generation of an “immutable vaccination record.”

#### 3. Certificate issuance & distribution&#x20;

The certificate/credentialing module is an integral part of DIVOC and the issuance can be triggered whenever a vaccination event has been completed within the [**facility app**](facility-app.md) or it can be integrated with the vaccination system of the country. What this module allows:

* Countries can use this module to issue digitally verifiable certificates to the entire population at speed and scale in a controlled manner post-vaccination.
* The certificates can be distributed in both digital and physical forms. You can distribute certificates in print, pdf, and other formats via the [**facility app**](facility-app.md). It can also be downloaded by citizens using the [**citizen portal**](citizen-portal.md). If the country has an authorised third-party app, it can be integrated with DIVOC's credentialing module to fetch certificates from the certificate registry and view/download them.
* Generates WHO-DDCC compliant digital vaccination certificates with a W3C JSON schema, for every resident after successful inoculation. To aid travel into other countries, the certificate module supports on-demand services for travellers to export their vaccination certificates to other formats (e.g. EU-DCC, SmartHealthCard), used in the destination countries.
* The module supports additional services, including certificate verification, certificate update/correction, and certificate revocation.
* The public key of the adopter country can be published using DIVOC’s verification page that can be embedded into the country's vaccination program-specific website/portal.

#### [4.  Citizen portal](citizen-portal.md)&#x20;

DIVOC provides a public portal that can be used for citizen-specific activities such as self-registration and appointment booking for one or multiple programs. It can also be used to download and verify certificates.

#### 5. Feedback&#x20;

Enables digital administrative feedback and side-effect reporting by beneficiaries or their caretakers. The feedback module can be integrated with a country's analytics system or even with an AEFI (adverse event following immunisation) system for research and analysis of the reported side effects.

#### 6. Analytics&#x20;

The performance monitoring dashboard gives day-to-day details about an ongoing public health event such as vaccination.

### _Disclaimers:_&#x20;

* _Each section presents a demonstration of various modules and features of DIVOC._&#x20;
* _It is an illustration of a sample use case and not a part of any vaccination certification program._&#x20;
* _The system resets itself periodically. If it is temporarily unavailable, please try again in a few minutes._
