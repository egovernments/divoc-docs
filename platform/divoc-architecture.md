# DIVOC Architecture

Highly flexible and configurable, DIVOC’s architecture is designed to accommodate changes and allow the addition of new capabilities and functionalities. For example, during a vaccination campaign, you can configure vaccines, vaccination frequency, approved facilities, trained vaccinators, certificate templates, and authentication mechanisms, among others. Built on <mark style="color:orange;">**open source and open standards**</mark>, the DIVOC architecture ensures <mark style="color:orange;">**privacy and security by design**</mark>.

## **Architecture highlights**

* DIVOC has been built using a micro-services architecture with open API integration capabilities. It can be hosted on the cloud and on-premise cloud.
* It is built on top of the generalised electronic registry and the credentialing framework is available under Sunbird Registry and Credentialing, as well as on-premise bare metal servers.
* DIVOC’s modules can work in various combinations based on a country’s requirements as well as end-user needs. Accordingly, countries can use specific or all micro-services.

* It is designed to plug and play with different certificate distribution schemes, such as printed with QR code, digital using smartphones, SMS/email attachments, digital lockers, etc.
* Allows interoperability with various ID, payment, and other systems.

* DIVOC is designed to cater to the diversity of use cases in terms of the choice of the facility (such as government and to private facilities) across geographies within a country; choice of payment (government funding, employer funding, or individual funding, among others); and choice of IDs (digital IDs, and mobile numbers.
* The platform is extensible. For example, many parts of the software can be extended, as well as replaced with country-specific components without having to customise. This, in turn, facilitates easy upgradability.
