# Printing Certificates at a Facility

## Create a user type

The facility/system administrator can print the certificates. The administrator can also create a user type (from the list of available roles) for a person who will print the certificates. Click [**here**](adding-a-user-type-in-divoc.md) to add a user type in DIVOC.&#x20;

## Steps to print certificates at a facility

### Step 1:

Once the user has been created, the person can log in to the portal using the following URL: [**https://demo-divoc.egov.org.in/portal**](https://demo-divoc.egov.org.in/portal). Enter the registered mobile number, and the OTP, and click on "login to portal."
