# FAQ

## **Who is building DIVOC software and how is it licensed?**

All software components within DIVOC are built as open source, funded using philanthropic capital, made available free of charge to anyone around the world. It is built using other open source components/libraries. This project is maintained by [eGov Foundation](https://egov.org.in), India.

## **How can countries benefit from this?**

Any country can freely use DIVOC, manage the platform within their control, and roll it out to their citizens to enable large scale vaccination programs. Since DIVOC software is open source, there are no royalties, charges, or licensing of any nature.

## **Can countries host it themselves? Who can help?**

**Yes**, countries can host it themselves and keep all control to themselves including data. Countries may engage any consulting and system integrator organization to help install, configure, run, monitor, and manage.

## **Given new medicines will be approved, how does DIVOC allow the flexibility to on-board newly approved vaccinations?**

DIVOC provides an approved medicine registry which allows authorities to add/remove approved vaccination medicines along with their frequencies.

## **I want to use DIVOC to manage multiple vaccination programs across various parts of the country. Is that possible?**

**Yes**, DIVOC is designed to manage multiple vaccination programs concurrently. For each program, both facilities and medicines can be managed within DIVOC.

## **Does DIVOC allow only Government facilities or does it also allow use of private facilities?**

DIVOC software platform is built to provide flexibility to the adopter through the facility registry. Facility registry functionality built into DIVOC allows adopters to choose either only Government facilities, or only private facilities, or a combination of both. It depends completely on how the adopter wants to roll out the vaccination program.

## **Does DIVOC allow the adopter to control the rollout of vaccination in particular geographies?**

**Yes**, adopters can "activate" only those facilities in particular geographic areas if they wish to roll out region by region. Activation and deactivation can be done as an ongoing basis allowing on-boarding and off-boarding of facilities and operators.

## **Does the DIVOC system allow managing vaccine supply and usage?**

**No**, DIVOC is not meant to be used for vaccine supply and logistics. But, DIVOC can seamlessly be integrated with existing systems through its APIs.

## **Does DIVOC allow the adopter to control the rollout rate based on medicine supply?**

**Yes**, adopters can specify "per facility, per day" rate within the registry to ensure throttled roll out based on medicine supply. At any time, adopters can change the control parameters to increase/decrease rate of rollout in various geographies.

## **I have 1000's of facilities. Can I manage facility parameters based at region level instead of one by one?**

**Yes**, DIVOC allows facility and operator control parameters to be updated in bulk for a whole region such as district or state making management easier.

## **What happens to people who have no mobile or ID of any sort?**

Currently DIVOC is designed to work only where some authenticable ID (such as mobile or email or Aadhaar) is available. But, since DIVOC is an open source software, adopters can extend it to also allow scenarios where only a physical ID is available or no ID is available.

## **How do facilities get paid? Does DIVOC take care of payments?**

**No**, DIVOC does not deal with payments per se. It only leverages existing payment methods available in a country. DIVOC analytics module can produce necessary reports to generate facility performance metrics etc which can be used in making payment decisions.

## **Does the DIVOC system allow issuance of "digital vaccination certificates" to people?**

**Yes**, digital credentialing is the core module of DIVOC. Certificates are natively digital, machine readable, digitally signed, verifiable, and also printable with a QR code making it easy for people to keep it electronically or physically. Template of the certificates, formats, etc can be configured based on your need.

## **How do people get their "digital vaccination certificates"?**

If the vaccine recipient has provided her/his mobile/email, then a link to download the certificate is sent to them. If not, the facility can download, print and give it. At any point in time, users can also go to public portal and retrieve the certificate by giving their mobile/email. In the case of India, an authentication system like Aadhaar can also be used to allow recipients to access their certificates in a secure way. With user consent, these can also be integrated with other applications such as India's Digilocker, CommonPass, TravelPass, and other digital health wallets.

## **Unlike India, we don't have Digilocker and Aadhaar. Does DIVOC come with a built-in certificate repository?**

**Yes**, a certificate repository is integrated within the DIVOC system. Certificates are natively digital, machine readable, digitally signed, verifiable, and also printable with a QR code making it easy for people to keep it electronically or physically. Any digitally authenticable ID such as mobile, email, etc can be used to allow users securely access their certificate from the repository.
