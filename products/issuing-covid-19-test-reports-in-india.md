**Verifying test reports:** The verifiable QR code on each test report enables citizens to carry/show their latest COVID-19 test results securely. DIVOC has set up a [**verification portal**](https://verify.icmr.org.in/) that can be used to verify a test certificate by scanning the QR code. These reports can also be verified offline by third-party apps.
